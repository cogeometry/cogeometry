### [Shimura data in terms of $$B(G,\mathbb{R})$$](/assets/ShimuraData.pdf)

In my master's thesis I studied the twistor projective line, which can be seen as the archimedean analogue of the Fargues-Fontaine curve. In this thesis I elaborated this connection and tried to make use of it to show that possibly Shimura data can be given a description in terms of $$B(G,\mathbb{R})$$.
