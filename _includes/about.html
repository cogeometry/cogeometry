<h1>Louis Jaburi</h1>

<p>
    I am about to graduate as a PhD student at Imperial College under the supervision of <a
        href="https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~acaraian/">Ana
        Caraiani</a>!
</p>

<p>
    I worked on arithmetic geometry, representation theory and number theory. In particular, this includes the p-adic
    geometry of
    Shimura varieties, and Emerton-Gee stacks.
</p>

<p>
    Now, I am transitioning to work on various aspects of machine learning with the goal to positively shape the future.
    Particular interests include: interpretability, AI safety, theory of deep learning, machine learning for automated
    theorem
    proving.
