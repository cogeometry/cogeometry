<h1>Louis Jaburi</h1>

<p>
I am a PhD student at Imperial College under the supervision of <a href="https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~acaraian/">Ana Caraiani</a> in my last year. 
</p>

<p>
I am interested in arithmetic geometry and number theory. In particular, this includes the p-adic geometry of Shimura varieties, and Emerton-Gee stacks.
