This is a mixed environment where you can have normal text with a dollar sign $ and inline latex $$ \lVert x \rVert $$! and block latex 

$$ 
    \lVert (x, y) \rVert := \sqrt { x^2 + y^2 }
$$

Always use `$$` for latex, weither it is a block or not depends on if it appears as a paragraph in the source code.
