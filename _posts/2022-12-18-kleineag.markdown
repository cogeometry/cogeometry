This time the topic will be "The geometric Satake equivalence" following Richarz's approach via universally locally acyclic sheaves (https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.5314). See the attached [poster](/assets/Geomsatplan.pdf) for more details.
 
There will be a survey soon for those interested in giving a talk.
