To see what formal geometry attempts to do, we might want to understand where "classical" algebraic geometry has its shortcomings. So while the world of schemes is very useful, because of its great generality, there is a toll to be paid, when we want to focus on more special kinds of schemes. For example, complex projective varieties. By this I mean things like $$ V(f)\subset \mathbb{P}^n_{\mathbb{C}}$$, where $$\mathbb{P}^n_{\mathbb{C}}$$ is the smooth complex **manifold** and $$V(f)$$ is the vanishing set of a homogenous polynomial.

By Serre's GAGA, every complex projective variety arises from a projective scheme $$X/\mathbb{C}$$, in the sense that it will be isomorphic to the $$\mathbb{C}$$-points $$X(\mathbb{C})$$. Similar statements also exist for coherent sheaves. So complex geometry is not too far away from algebraic geometry... But wait! From the algebraic geometry point of view $$X(\mathbb{C})$$ only sees the Zariski topology, but of course $$X(\mathbb{C})$$ also naturally has the complex topology, which is finer. So heuristically we might hope that there is more information to be retrieved. Here are two instances, where working over $$\mathbb{C}$$ is beneficial: 

1. Hodge theory! Let $$H^n(X(\mathbb{C}),\mathbb{C})$$ be either the singular cohomology, or the de Rham cohomology, the former crucially using the complex topology, while the latter has an algebraic analogue, the *algebraic* de Rham cohomology. In any case, the concise way to state the Hodge theorem is as follows

    **Theorem** Let $$X$$ be as above and smooth. Then we have a natural decomposition (as $$\mathbb{C}$$ vector spaces)

    $$H^n(X(\mathbb{C}),\mathbb{C})\cong\bigoplus_{p+q=n} H^{p,q}(X(\mathbb{C})) $$

    and  furthermore

    $$  H^{p,q}(X(\mathbb{C}))\cong \overline{ H^{q,p}(X(\mathbb{C}))}.$$


    The groups $$H^{p,q}(X(\mathbb{C}))$$ can be defined as Dolbeaut cohomology groups, but one can also think of them as 
    $$H^{p,q}(X(\mathbb{C}))\cong H^p(X,\Omega^q)$$. 
    Now to be fair the first part of this theorem can be proved also in a more general set up, by showing that some spectral sequence degenerates. But then the decomposition will be not canonical and more importantly the second part of theorem, the Hodge symmetry, is unique to the $$\mathbb{C}$$ case. One way to prove the above theorem that I am aware of is preseneted in the book by Voision [ref] and uses harmonic analysis. 

2. The second example uses the exponential function. To be more precise we have the exponential short exact sequence

    $$ 
        0\to \underline{\mathbb{Z}}\xrightarrow{\cdot 2\pi i} \mathcal{O}\xrightarrow{exp( \_ )} \mathcal{O}^*\to 0.
    $$

    This induces a long exact sequence, which should be familiar with those who studied some complex geometry/curves

    $$...H^1(X(\C),\Ox)\to H^1(X(\C),\Ox^*)\to H^2(X(\C),\underline{\Z})\to... $$
    
The above examples can be also elaborated and there are more examples of course.

But what happens if we don't consider $$ \C$$ or $$\R$$, which is nothing else but the completion of $$\Q$$ for the real topology. We might wonder what happens, if we consider varieties over $$\Q_p$$, or its algebraic closure, or its completion. Again since these fields have more structure, a non-trivial topology namely, we can hope for a theory of something like $$p$$-adic geometry (in constrast to complex geometry). And put in simple terms- this is what formal geometry attempts to do (more generally maybe also for any kind of topological ring). But things turn out to be not as easy as in the complex case. So far at least, there is no "one construction" that is fit best for all purposes. Each concept, that will be briefly introduced in the next section, resolves certain issues, but in return imposes restrictions in a different way. 

One of the first things that clearly distinguishes the $$p$$-adic topology form the real topology are the closed and open unit disk 

$$ \Ox_K=\{x\in K\mid ||x||\leq 1 \} \ , \ m_K=\{x\in K\mid ||x||< 1 \}, $$

this is now a local ring! So to liberate us from the real world, we have to come up with new techniques and rethink notions, which we are familiar with. Throughout the unit disk will follow us as an essential example, as a toy case, to which we can apply to our new constructions. 

<h1>A map of formal geometry</h1>

Since a map is always only an approximation of the territory that it encaptures, what I will write is only a sketch of the whole area and as such to be read with an appropriate amount of caution. 

Before introducing the different approaches, what are reasonable things to expect from them? 
- Ideally we end up with a functor:

    $$ S:\textrm{rings with a topology+...}^{op}\to \textrm{???-spaces} $$

    as an analogue of 

    $$ Spec:\textrm{rings}^{op}\to \textrm{Locally ringed spaces}. $$

    So that the objects we construct live in a reasonable ambient category, e.g. it should be a topological space with a sheaf, to begin with. Also this functor should be fully faithfull. Note also that I am intentionally vague with the domain category of the functor, as it will vary from approach to approach.

- Now let's say we have $$ S(A)$$, where $$A$$ is an object in our domain category. $$S(A)$$ will have a topology, sometimes also natural Grothendieck topologies. Let $$f,g\in A$$ be some elements. The following sets should be open:

    $$ \{x\in S(A)| f(x)\neq 0 \} $$

    analogous to the scheme case. It again remains vague what I mean here e.g. by $$f(x)$$, but the usual case of affine schemes should provide some intuition. Now furthermore we would of course like to include more open sets! The straight-forward approach would be something like

    $$ \{x\in S(A)| |f(x)|\leq 1 \}$$

    or if we are feeling very bold, maybe more generally

    $$ \{x\in S(A)| |f(x)|\leq g(x) \}.$$

- On the other hand if $$I\subset A$$ is a "nice" ideal (e.g. open for the topology on $$A$$), then something like 

    $$ V(I)=\{x\in S(A)| f(x)=0\} $$

    should be closed in $$S(A)$$, maybe something like $$S(A/I)\hookrightarrow$ S(A)$$. 

- Having talked about topology, it seems reasonable to bring up the subject of gluing. Just like with schemes, in our category of $$\textrm{???-spaces}$$ we should be able to take some kind of "gluing" datum and get a new $$???-space$$, which of course locally looks like $$S(A)$$. 

- It would be nice to have things like fibre products and maybe other kinds of (co)limits. Especially, if our domain category has some kind of (co)limit, the functor $$S$$ should preserve it.
