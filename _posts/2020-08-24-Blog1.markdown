<h1>A Motivation</h1>

To see what formal geometry attempts to do, we might want to understand where "classical" algebraic geometry has its shortcomings. So while the world of schemes is very useful, because of its great generality, there is a toll to be paid, when we want to focus on more special kinds of schemes. For example, complex projective varieties. By this I mean things like $$ V(f)\subset \mathbb{P}^n_{\mathbb{C}}$$, where $$\mathbb{P}^n_{\mathbb{C}}$$ is the smooth complex **manifold** and $$V(f)$$ is the vanishing set of a homogenous polynomial.

By Serre's GAGA, every complex projective variety arises from a projective scheme $$X/\mathbb{C}$$, in the sense that it will be isomorphic to the $$\mathbb{C}$$-points $$X(\mathbb{C})$$. Similar statements also exist for coherent sheaves. So complex geometry is not too far away from algebraic geometry... But wait! From the algebraic geometry point of view $$X(\mathbb{C})$$ only sees the Zariski topology, but of course $$X(\mathbb{C})$$ also naturally has the complex topology, which is finer. So heuristically we might hope that there is more information to be retrieved. Here are two instances, where working over $$\mathbb{C}$$ is beneficial: 

1. Hodge theory! Let $$H^n(X(\mathbb{C}),\mathbb{C})$$ be either the singular cohomology, or the de Rham cohomology, the former crucially using the complex topology, while the latter has an algebraic analogue, the *algebraic* de Rham cohomology. In any case, the concise way to state the Hodge theorem is as follows

**Theorem** Let $$X$$ be as above. Then we have a natural decomposition (as $$\mathbb{C}$$ vector spaces)

$$H^n(X(\mathbb{C}),\mathbb{C})\cong\bigoplus_{p+q=n} H^{p,q}(X(\mathbb{C})) $$

and  furthermore

$$  H^{p,q}(X(\mathbb{C}))\cong \overline{ H^{q,p}(X(\mathbb{C}))}.$$


The groups $$H^{p,q}(X(\mathbb{C}))$$ can be defined as Dolbeaut cohomology groups, but one can also think of them as 
$$H^{p,q}(X(\mathbb{C}))\cong H^p(X,\Omega^q)$$. 
\newline Now to be fair the first part of this theorem can be proved also in a more general set up, by showing that some spectral sequence degenerates. But then the decomposition will be not canonical and more importantly the second part of theorem, the Hodge symmetry, is unique to the $$\mathbb{C}$$ case. One way to prove the above theorem that I am aware of is preseneted in the book by Voision [ref] and uses harmonic analysis. 

2. The second example uses the exponential function. To be more precise we have the exponential short exact sequence

$$ 
    0\to \underline{\mathbb{Z}}\xrightarrow{2\pi i} \mathcal{O}\to \mathcal{O}^*\to 0
$$

Always use `$$` for latex, weither it is a block or not depends on if it appears as a paragraph in the source code.
