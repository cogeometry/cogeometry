# Louis Jaburi

I am a first year PhD student at Imperial College under the supervision of [Ana Caraiani](https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~acaraian/). 

I am interested in arithmetic geometry and number theory. In particular, this includes the mod p and formal geometry of Shimura varieties.

 [Shimura data in terms of $$B(G,\mathbb{R})$$](/assests/ShimuraData.pdf)

 In my master's thesis I studied the twistor projective line, which can be seen as the archimedean analogue of the Fargues-Fontaine curve. I tried to elaborate this connection and make use of it to show that possibly Shimura data can be given a description in terms of $$B(G,\mathbb{R})$$.
